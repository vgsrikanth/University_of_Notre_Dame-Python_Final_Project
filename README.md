# University of Notre Dame Python Final Project
Python Final Project as part of Course work at University of Notre Dame M.S Data Science program.

The Question / Problem
I have been hired as an indepedent auditor by Colorado’s Boulder County Assessors Office to help with the following problems.

Problem 1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Annual Report Insights
The Accessors Office is set to release their annual report on the valuation of residential single family properties. They have asked me to explore the data and produce at least 2 key findings they can share in their annual report to the public.

Problem 2: Estimate Home Values and use  KNN Algorithm (K Nearest Neighbour) for property valuation
The Assessors Office needs help improving their valuation process for residential single family properties. They have asked me to write a KNN alogorithm to value new homes based on similar home sales. By law, residential properties must be valued by using a "market approach". This predicts the price a property would bring on the open market in a transaction between a willing, informed, and knowledgeable buyer and seller. A property can be valued through the process of analyzing comparable sales. A comparable sale is any qualified sale in the last 5 years (January 2015 - December 2020).

The central factors used by the Assessors for property valuation are:

Location
Living Area (SQFT)
Age of the Home
Finished Basement

Problem 3: Ethics Review
Fairness and accuracy are vitally important. If the assessed values are too high, the property owners will overpay in taxes. If the assessed values are too low then we may fall short of the capital needed to cover the budget approved by legislators. As such, thinking through the impact of how we predict home prices is vitial.
